# HFAC — internet calls on the media audio channel

Android voice calls normally run on the *voice communication* audio path
(`USAGE_VOICE_COMMUNICATION` / `MODE_IN_COMMUNICATION`). That path forces
Bluetooth into the low-quality SCO/HFP profile and applies aggressive,
narrowband-era processing. **HFAC** places internet (WebRTC) calls on the
**media** path (`USAGE_MEDIA`, `STREAM_MUSIC`) instead, so call audio gets the
same quality as music playback.

## How the audio routing works

| Peripheral | Output | Input | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Wired / USB headset | Headset, media stream | Headset mic | Works by default — media audio and mic both route to the wired device. |
| Bluetooth earphones | **A2DP (media profile)** — full quality | **Phone's built-in mic** | We never start SCO and never enter `MODE_IN_COMMUNICATION`, so BT stays on A2DP. A2DP has no mic channel, so capture naturally falls back to the phone mic — exactly the intended split. |
| Nothing connected | Loudspeaker, media stream | Phone mic | Echo-prone; WebRTC's software AEC3 echo canceller is enabled to compensate. Quality of echo cancellation varies by device/volume. |

Key implementation points (see `android/app/src/main/java/com/hfac/calls/rtc/WebRtcEngine.kt`):

- `JavaAudioDeviceModule` is built with `AudioAttributes(USAGE_MEDIA)` → playback is an ordinary media `AudioTrack`.
- Capture uses `MediaRecorder.AudioSource.MIC` (not `VOICE_COMMUNICATION`), so no narrowband voice-call preprocessing.
- `AudioManager` stays in `MODE_NORMAL`; `startBluetoothSco()` is never called.
- Hardware AEC/NS are disabled in favour of WebRTC's software AEC3/NS, which work regardless of the audio path.
- Opus is tuned for quality via SDP: 48 kHz fullband, FEC on, DTX off, `maxaveragebitrate=128000`, and the RTP sender's max bitrate is raised to match.
- Optional **Hi-Fi mode** disables echo cancellation / noise suppression / AGC entirely — use only with a headset.

## Rooms

- **Duo room** — capped at exactly 2 participants.
- **Group room** — full-mesh audio, capped at 8 participants (mesh is the right topology for "best quality on a good connection": no SFU transcoding, direct peer links).

A room is created by one user and joined by others via any of:

1. **Link** — `http(s)://<server>/j/<code>` (the server serves a landing page with an "open in app" deep link `hfac://join/<code>`)
2. **QR code** — generated in-app (encodes the link), scannable in-app
3. **8-digit numeric code** — typed manually

## Web calling client (iOS / any browser, no app install)

`/call/` (`server/web/`) is a vanilla JS/HTML/CSS client using the browser's
native `RTCPeerConnection` and `WebSocket` — same signaling protocol, same
Opus SDP tuning, same per-peer safety codes as the Android app, reusing the
existing server with no changes to its wire protocol. Every `/j/<code>` page
links to `/call/?code=<code>`, and `/` links to `/call/` directly.

**Scoped to wired-headphone / speaker audio.** There is no web API that lets
a page control Bluetooth audio profile the way the Android app's
`AudioAttributes`/`AudioManager` code does — that control (`AVAudioSession`
on iOS, `AudioManager` on Android) is native-only. A web page cannot force
Bluetooth into A2DP the way the app does; this client doesn't attempt it.

**Known v1 limitations:**
- No QR generation/scanning (link + 8-digit code only)
- No background audio: iOS Safari suspends the tab when backgrounded or the
  screen locks, dropping the call — keep the tab foregrounded and the screen
  on for the duration of a call. A native app (with a foreground service, as
  the Android app has) is the only real fix for this.

## Repository layout

```
server/    Node.js WebSocket signaling server (rooms, codes, join page)
server/web/  Browser calling client served at /call/ (no app install)
android/   Android app (Kotlin, libwebrtc)
```

## Running the signaling server

```bash
cd server
npm install
npm start            # listens on 0.0.0.0:8787 (PORT env var to change)
```

The server only relays signaling (SDP/ICE) — call audio flows peer-to-peer.

## Deploying to the internet (Render + Metered TURN)

1. **Render**: dashboard → New → Blueprint → point at this repo
   (`render.yaml` deploys `server/` as a free web service). Note the URL,
   e.g. `https://hfac-signaling.onrender.com`.
2. **Metered** (TURN relay for peers behind carrier-grade NAT): create a free
   account at metered.ca, then set `METERED_DOMAIN` (e.g. `yourapp.metered.live`)
   and `METERED_SECRET_KEY` (Dashboard → Developers → Secret Key) in the
   Render service's environment. The app receives STUN + TURN credentials
   inline when it creates/joins a room — nothing is baked into the APK, and
   there's no standalone public endpoint to scrape them from. Note: Metered's
   free tier doesn't support auto-expiring credentials (HTTP 400 on that
   API), so this currently falls back to a still-valid but static credential
   pair; upgrade the Metered plan or self-host coturn for real rotation.
   Alternatively point `TURN_URLS`/`TURN_USERNAME`/`TURN_CREDENTIAL` at your
   own coturn.
3. **Bake the server URL into the app**: set repo variable `HFAC_SERVER_URL`
   (GitHub → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables) to the
   Render URL. CI passes it into every build; users never enter a URL.
   Local builds: `./gradlew assembleDebug -PHFAC_SERVER_URL=https://...`.

## Security model

- **Call audio is always end-to-end encrypted** (DTLS-SRTP, mandated by
  WebRTC). TURN relays and the signaling server carry only ciphertext.
- **Safety codes**: each peer link shows a short code derived from both ends'
  DTLS certificate fingerprints. Both sides seeing the same code rules out a
  man-in-the-middle at the signaling layer — compare it out loud for
  sensitive calls.
- **TLS**: release builds refuse cleartext; use `https://`/`wss://` servers.
  Debug builds allow `ws://` for LAN testing.
- **Abuse limits** (server): 10 join attempts/min and 20 room creations/hour
  per IP, 300 messages/10 s per connection, 64 KB max message, 500 active
  rooms, 12-hour room lifetime, 5 requests/min per IP on the standalone
  `GET /ice` (kept for manual testing; the app itself never calls it).
- **TURN credentials aren't a bare public endpoint.** They ride along in the
  `created`/`joined` WebSocket responses, so obtaining a set requires
  actually creating or joining a room and is covered by the limits above —
  not just an unauthenticated `curl`. No secret is baked into the APK to
  gate this further, since anything shipped in a public APK can be
  extracted; the real backstop is the rate limiting itself.
- **Room access = code possession** (like a meeting link). Codes are
  8 random digits; don't post them publicly.
- Peers in a call see each other's IP addresses (inherent to P2P).

## Building the app

Requirements: JDK 17, Android SDK (platform 35). `android/local.properties`
must point at the SDK (`sdk.dir=...`).

```bash
cd android
./gradlew assembleDebug
# APK: app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

On first launch set the **server URL** (e.g. `ws://192.168.1.10:8787`) and a
display name, then create or join a room. Emulator talking to a server on the
host machine: use `ws://10.0.2.2:8787`.

## Cutting a release

The app version and the website's displayed version are two separate values
that must be bumped together:

1. `android/app/build.gradle.kts` — bump `versionCode` (+1) and `versionName`
   (e.g. `"0.5.0"`).
2. `server/server.js` — bump the `APP_VERSION` constant to match (or set the
   `APP_VERSION` env var on Render instead of editing code).
3. Commit, merge `develop` → `main`, `git tag vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z`.
   CI builds, signs, and publishes the release automatically.

`versionName` also drives the "Powered by Nightfury" footer in the app
(via `BuildConfig.VERSION_NAME`, no separate edit needed there).

## Known limitations

- Speaker + phone-mic (no peripheral) relies on software echo cancellation;
  results vary by device. A headset is recommended.
- Media-stream playback obeys the *media* volume, not the call volume.
- Bluetooth mics are intentionally unused (using them would force SCO and
  drop output quality — the whole thing this app avoids).
